# Wedawaru Plus Web Application

###### Wedawaru Plus is a mobile app that is supported by a web application developed using React.js as the front-end technology. This README.md file provides step-by-step instructions on how to start the front-end development of the Wedawaru Plus web application.

### Front-end Development with React.js

###### React.js is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components that are efficient, fast, and easy to maintain. The Wedawaru Plus web application is developed using React.js for the front-end.

#### Prerequisites

###### Before starting the front-end development of the Wedawaru Plus web application, you need to have the following installed on your local machine:

> Node.js: You can download and install Node.js from the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org/).

> Yarn: Yarn is a package manager for Node.js that is commonly used in React.js projects. You can install Yarn globally on your machine by following the instructions on the Yarn website (https://yarnpkg.com/).

#### Setting up the Front-end Development Environment

###### Once you have Node.js and Yarn installed on your machine, follow these steps to set up the front-end development environment for the Wedawaru Plus web application:

> Clone the Wedawaru Plus repository from the GitHub repository: https://github.com/your-username/wedawaru-plus.git Replace your-username with your actual GitHub username.

> Navigate to the source/frontend/app directory of the cloned repository in your terminal or command prompt.

> Run the following command to install the required dependencies using Yarn:

```javascript

> yarn

```

###### This will download and install all the dependencies listed in the package.json file for the front-end development of the Wedawaru Plus web application.

> After the dependencies are successfully installed, you can start the front-end development server by running the following command:

```javascript

> yarn start

```
#### Accessing the Web Application

###### Once the front-end development server is running, you can access the Wedawaru Plus web application by navigating to http://localhost:3000/ in your web browser. This is the default URL where the web application will be hosted during development.

#### Front-end Resources 

###### During the front-end development of the Wedawaru Plus web application, you can refer to the following resources to learn more about React.js and build efficient and maintainable user interfaces:

> React.js Documentation: The official documentation of React.js provides comprehensive information about the library, including tutorials, guides, and examples. You can access the React.js documentation at https://reactjs.org/.

> React.js GitHub Repository: The GitHub repository of React.js contains the source code of the library, as well as issue trackers, community discussions, and code examples. You can explore the React.js GitHub repository at https://github.com/facebook/react.

> React.js Community: The React.js community is a vibrant community of developers who share their knowledge, experiences, and best practices related to React.js. You can join the community and participate in discussions, ask questions, and learn from other developers at https://reactjs.org/community/support.html.

###### With the front-end development environment set up and the resources available, you can now start developing the Wedawaru Plus web application using React.js. Happy coding!
